A brief engineering exercise for Sitka Technology Group.

## Setup
Download or clone directory. Move to the directory in the command line and run 'js index.js'.

## Technologies Used
 * Node.js
 * npm
 * readline

## Approach
I chose Node and npm for an easy setup. I chose the 'readline' package for easy command line input.

## Improvements
* Needs a global balance variable for when a user pays a partial amount of total.
* Could have more realistic credit/debit card input.
* Allow removing custom amount of units from cart.
* Make "b" the standard option for going back.
